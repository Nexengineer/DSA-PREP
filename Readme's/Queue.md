## **Queue**

The interface Queue is available in the java.util package and does extend the Collection interface. It is used to keep the elements that are processed in the First In First Out (FIFO) manner. It is an ordered list of objects, where insertion of elements occurs at the end of the list, and removal of elements occur at the beginning of the list.

Being an interface, the queue requires, for the declaration, a concrete class, and the most common classes are the LinkedList and PriorityQueue in Java.

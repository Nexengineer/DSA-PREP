## **Bitmasking**   

A bit is a boolean value that can be either 0 or 1. Bitmasking is the act of applying a mask over a value to keep, change or modify a piece of given information. A mask determines which bits to take and which bits to clear off a binary number.     
       
Bitmasking can be used to mask a value to represent the subsets of a set using various bitwise operations. The concept of bitmasking is used along with dynamic programming to solve a wide range of problems.     

One of the useful applications of bitmasking is to mask a number to represent the subsets of a set. For example, if we have a set of 3 elements, then we can represent all the subsets of the set using 8 bits.

## **Linked Lists**

Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java.util package. This class is an implementation of the LinkedList data structure which is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. 

Linked lists are  similar to arrays but unlike arrays it doesn't store data in contiguous locations.
